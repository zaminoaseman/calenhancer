## ✨ Features

-   **🔒 Zero-Knowledge Privacy**: Your original calendar URL is encrypted (AES-GCM 256-bit) into a secure token. The server decrypts it in memory, fetches your data, and forgets it immediately. No logging.

-   **🗺️ Map Friendly**: Automatically injects Apple Maps compatible GPS coordinates for Campus locations (CUBE, SHED, etc.). Addresses are now clickable in iOS/macOS Calendar!

-   **📅 One-Click Subscribe**: Dedicated button to instantly open your native calendar app (`webcal://`).

-   **🧹 strict Hygiene**:
    -   Removes cluttered emojis from titles.
    -   Formats course IDs and entrance notes clearly.
    -   Strips PII (Attendees/Organizers) for privacy.

-   **🚀 Fast & Secure**: Runs on Cloudflare Edge with streaming processing.
